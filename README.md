# Unity DOTS Snippets

Speed up development with Unity DOTS by having quick access to some of the most common operations and code structures necessary when working with component systems.

This is usually not an issue but it can be tedious, repetitive and sometimes hard to remember the exact API or calls.

This extension will solve the issue for you with a simple `:[command]` + `TAB`/`ENTER` and your up and running.

PR are open to make this even better!
